DynamicForms
============

DynamicForms is a fully implemented system to allow you to create dynamic forms 
without the need for a pre-existing model for each form. 

This plugin functions as a self-contained mini-application. That is very easy to work with.

Installation
============

BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
dynamic_forms relies on a few plugins dependencies. 
First, make sure you have the validates_as_email plugin installed. This can be downloaded at http://github.com/gbdev/validates_as_email.
Next, make sure you have the state_select plugin. http://github.com/bansalakhil/state_select.

To install the plugin, download the source to the plugins directory of your rails app. 
Then from your application root directory run the install file with:

ruby vendor/plugins/dynamic_forms/install.rb

The install program will ask you to input the names of the layouts to interface dynamic_forms with.
It will first ask for an administrative layout to use when creating the forms and viewing submissions.
Then it will ask for a primary front-end layout for the user to view and submit the form from. 
NOTE: Make sure both layouts entered include the javascript defaults.

Below is a transcript of a successful install.
t
Please Enter an Administrator Layout name: 
admin
Please Enter a Front-End Layout name: 
primary
Installing layout files into the controllers...
        layout 'secondary'
Done
Installing layout files into the controllers...
        layout 'secondary'
Done
Installing layout files into the controllers...
        layout 'primary'
Done

This is purely so that you can customize the plugin to fit into your application better. 

One more step, Just run rake db:migrate:dynamic_forms.

This will setup the two database tables that dynamic_forms needs to function. Once this is done, you should be ready to go.

Usage
=====

The plugin automatically creates a series of webpages to create and use the forms. 
There are three controllers for three different uses.
1. Administrator creation and editing of forms. "admin_dynamic_forms_controller.rb"
2. Front-End Form display and submission. "dynamic_forms_controller.rb"
3. Administrator managing of Form Submissions. "dynamic_form_response_controller.rb"

Just navigate to http://[your_app]/admin_dynamic_forms to get started. Here you will create the form and fields to be used.
Then navigate to http://[your_app]/dynamic_forms to view the forms. Select one and the user can fill out a form and submit it.
When a form is submitted, an email is sent as defined in the form creation as a notification.
Navigate to http://[your_app]/dynamic_form_response to view all of the submissions.
