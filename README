DynamicForms
============

DynamicForms is a fully implemented system to allow you to create dynamic forms 
without the need for a pre-existing model for each form. 


Installation
============

To install the plugin, download the source to the plugins directory of your rails app. 
Then from your application root directory run the install file with:

ruby vendor/plugins/dynamic_forms/install.rb

The install program will ask you to input the names of the layouts to interface dynamic_forms with.
It will first ask for an administrative layout to use when creating the forms and viewing submissions.
Then it will ask for a primary front-end layout for the user to view and submit the form from. 

This is purely so that you can customize the plugin to fit into your application better. 

One more step, Just run rake db:migrate:dynamic_forms.

This will setup the two database tables that dynamic_forms needs to function. Once this is done, you should be ready to go.
